ðŸ“‹ Manual Testing Instructions for Memo/useCallback Optimizations:

PERFORMANCE TESTING:
1. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Open browser DevTools (F12) and go to the "Performance" tab
3. Click "Record" to start performance profiling
4. Interact with the Advanced Filters:
   - Click "Advanced Filters" to open the panel
   - Add a filter group
   - Add conditions to the group
   - Change filter values
   - Change join operators (AND/OR)
   - Remove conditions
   - Remove groups
5. Stop the performance recording
6. Analyze the flame graph for unnecessary re-renders

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR WITH OPTIMIZATIONS:
âœ… AdvancedFilters component should only re-render when its props actually change
âœ… Data table should NOT re-render when modifying advanced filters (before clicking Apply)
âœ… FilterConditionComponent should only re-render when its specific condition changes
âœ… Callback functions should have stable references between renders
âœ… Computed values (hasActiveFilters, activeFilterCount) should only recalculate when filterGroups change

REACT DEVELOPER TOOLS TESTING:
1. Install React Developer Tools browser extension
2. Go to the "Profiler" tab in DevTools
3. Click "Start profiling"
4. Interact with advanced filters as described above
5. Stop profiling and analyze the component tree
6. Look for:
   - Minimal re-renders in the AdvancedFilters component
   - No re-renders in the main DataTable when modifying filters
   - Stable component references

CONSOLE TESTING:
You can also add temporary console.log statements to verify:
- Add console.log('AdvancedFilters render') at the start of the component
- Add console.log('DataTable render') at the start of DataTable component
- Observe that AdvancedFilters logs minimally and DataTable doesn't log during filter modifications

PERFORMANCE BENEFITS:
- Reduced CPU usage during filter interactions
- Smoother UI interactions with large datasets
- Better responsiveness when configuring complex filters
- Improved overall application performance

Press Ctrl+C to stop the development server when testing is complete.
